This repository contains two Python programs in Project folder and all class log book in Folder logbook and Norebooks in Notebooks folder for the  assignment.

These are the description for each assignment work

For projects 
Both programs are written in clear structure, and are designed to match the assignment requirements closely.

Project 1

Beckett Pizza Plaza (BPP) offers a 4-for-3 pizza deal:

The customer must order four pizzas

Each pizza may have a different price

The cheapest pizza is free

The program calculates:

The final total price

The percentage discount received (maximum 25%)

The program must also handle incorrect input such as letters, zero, or negative numbers.

How the Program Works

-Displays the program title

-Asks the user to enter the price of four pizzas

-Checks each input:

-Must be a number

-Must be greater than zero

-Adds all four prices together

-Finds the cheapest pizza

-Subtracts the cheapest price from the total

-Calculates the discount percentage

-Displays the final total and discount


For Project 2

Password Security Check

How the Program Works

-Prompts the user to enter a password

-Checks the length of the password

-If fewer than 9 characters, the program ends

-Randomly selects three positions in the password

-Asks the user to enter the letter at each position

-If the letter is:

-Correct  prints "Correct"

-Incorrect  prints "Security check failed." and stops

-If all three letters are correct, prints "Security check passed."

For Log Book
